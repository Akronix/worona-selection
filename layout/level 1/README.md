# LAYOUT - Level 1

We want you to replicate a real design.

- **Assets** you don't have to create any of the images from the design. You can use the images located under the assets folder.

- **Font** can downloaded in Google Fonts ([Poppins Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)).

- **Responsiveness** we are attaching the mobile, tablet and desktop designs, the result must be responsive and have a similar behaviour to the attached design.
