# LAYOUT - Level 1

!(design)[https://github.com/worona/selection-test-01/raw/master/layout/level%201/desktop.png]
We want you to replicate a real design. Here you have the expected result: [desktop](https://github.com/worona/selection-test-01/blob/master/layout/level%201/desktop.png), [tablet](https://github.com/worona/selection-test-01/blob/master/layout/level%201/tablet.png), [mobile](https://github.com/worona/selection-test-01/blob/master/layout/level%201/mobile.png).

- **Assets:** you don't have to create any of the images from the design. You can use the images located under the assets folder.

- **Font:** can be downloaded from Google Fonts ([Poppins Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)).

- **Responsiveness:** we are attaching the mobile, tablet and desktop designs. The result must be responsive and have a similar behaviour to the attached design.
