# LAYOUT - Level 2

In this exercise you have to create one screen from scratch, we are not providing a final design to reproduce. You are free to choose the colors, shapes and structure. The screen should contain the following elements:

#### - User profile

The user must know he's logged-in and be able to logout. Elements to display:
-  Avatar (*you can use a service like [randomuser](https://randomuser.me/) to generate the picture*)
- *Link** to settings
- *Link** to "logout"

>  [*] The links doesn't have to lead anywhere, you only have to code one HTML page. Modal alerts are welcome.

#### - Apps
A list of apps owned by this user. And an intuitive button to *create** a new app. Every "app element" will contain:

- An image/icon to recognize the app.
- The title of the Apps
- The WordPress URL of the Apps
- Delete button
- Edit button

> [*] The create button doesn't have to trigger any logic. This a HTML+CSS exercise.

### Mockups

Here you have some mockups containing all the elements described before. Feel free to use them as inspiration, you don't have to reproduce any of them. If you consider there is a better way to display the elements code it! :)
